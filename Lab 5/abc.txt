Tails, or The Amnesic Incognito Live System, is a security-focused Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at preserving privacy and anonymity.
[5] All its incoming and outgoing connections are forced to go through Tor,[6] and any non-anonymous connections are blocked.
 The system is designed to be booted as a live DVD or live USB, and will leave no digital footprint on the machine unless explicitly told to do so. 
 It can also be run as a virtual machine, with some additional security risks.[7] 
 The Tor Project provided financial support for its development in the beginnings of the project,[8] and continues to do so alongside numerous corporate and anonymous sponsors.
  Tails comes with UEFI Secure Boot.
